3 question trivia
Try to guess the answer to the 3 trivia questions. Google the answers if you fail!
Added semicolons where needed.
Made the entire thing a function
Made so if the user gets the wrong answer the question will repeat.
Fixed bug that made messages come up twice.

CHB Revisions:

1) Add Question contructor to create an array containing an object for each question (which includes the trivia question, correct answer, response if correct, response if incorrect).

2) Add Game Constructor to run game from each set of questions. Includes loop through each element (question object) in the array of quesitons.
